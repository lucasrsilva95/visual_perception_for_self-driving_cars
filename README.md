# Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars

This code was developed in the final project of the course "Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars", that is the third course of the Self-Driving Car Specialization offered by the University of Toronto.

The project goal was to extract useful scene information to allow self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their environment. The developed code was tested using some images provided by the Carla Simulator.
